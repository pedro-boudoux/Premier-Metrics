        <h2>About Premier Metrics</h2>
        <p>Premier Metrics is an in-depth Premier League statistics comparison website built by Pedro Boudoux, a Computer Science student at the University of Guelph.</p>
        <p>Created as a fun side project to learn React and PostgreSQL, Premier Metrics evolved into a full-featured web app that allows users to explore and compare player and team stats from the 2024/25 Premier League season. 
        I wanted to create a fun, interactive and accessible way to look at and compare complex football statistics for fans like myself to use either that be for FPL, debates with friends, or for finding hidden gems in the league.
