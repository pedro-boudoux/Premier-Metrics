          <h2>About Premier Metrics</h2>
          <p>
            Premier Metrics is an in-depth Premier League statistics comparison
            website built by Pedro Boudoux, a Computer Science student at the
            University of Guelph.
          </p>
          <p>
            Created as a fun side project to learn React and PostgreSQL, Premier
            Metrics evolved into a full-featured web app that allows users to
            explore and compare player and team stats from the 2024/25 Premier
            League season. I wanted to create a fun, interactive and accessible
            way to look at and compare complex football statistics for fans like
            myself to use either that be for FPL, debates with friends, or for
            finding hidden gems in the league.
          </p>
